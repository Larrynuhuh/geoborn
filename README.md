geoborn is a computational geometry library made purely for mathematical purposes to aid in scientific computation. It is written completely in JAX. 
The main pillars of this project on which it was built are 1) n-dimensionality, the abiltity to perform any and all functions in higher dimensions with ease 2) abstraction, 
which means that this project is not afraid to be abstract and dense with mathematics. It's core ability is differentiability, provided by JAX.

It is meant to work side by side with JAX and its ecosystem.
